        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>My Grandmother 'Nanaw' Rowan made the most 
            delicious meatloaf in the state. When she 
            passed away, she didn't leave me her recipe,
            but she left me the desire to recreate it. 
            I think this is it, in flavor and texture. 
            Don't let the number of ingredients 
            discourage you. It's part of the magic 
            in creating a masterpiece! </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <h3>Brown Sugar Glaze:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup ketchup</li>
            <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cider vinegar</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Meatloaf:</h3>

            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons prepared mustard</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon hot pepper sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
            <li>2/3 cup quick cooking oats</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef </li>
            <li>1/2 pound ground pork </li>
            <li>1/2 pound ground veal</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine ketchup, brown sugar, and cider 
                vinegar in a bowl; mix well.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 
                degrees C). Spray two 9x5-inch loaf 
                pans with cooking spray or line with 
                aluminum foil for easier cleanup (see 
                Cook's Note).</li>
            <li>Place onion and green pepper in covered 
                microwave container and cook until 
                softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Set aside to 
                cool.</li>
            <li>In large mixing bowl, combine garlic, 
                eggs, thyme, seasoned salt, black pepper, 
                mustard, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, 
                milk, and oats. Mix well. Stir in cooked 
                onion and green pepper. Add ground beef, 
                pork, and veal. With gloved hands, work 
                all ingredients together until 
                completely mixed and uniform.</li>
            <li>Divide meatloaf mixture in half and pat 
                half of mixture into each prepared loaf 
                pan. Brush loaves with half of the 
                glaze; set remainder of glaze 
                aside.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 50 minutes. 
                Remove pans from oven; carefully drain 
                fat. Brush loaves with remaining glaze. 
                Return to oven and bake for 10 minutes 
                more. Remove pans from oven and allow 
                meatloaf to stand for 15 minutes before 
                slicing.</li>
        </ol>
