        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This was my aunt's recipe for fudge, passed 
            down through the family. It's better than 
            any fudge I've ever had at the Jersey 
            shore, and easy enough to whip up in 
            15 minutes or so. </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (7 ounce) jar marshmallow creme</li>
            <li>1-1/2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>2/3 cup evaporated milk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups milk chocolate chips</li>
            <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped nuts</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Line an 8x8 inch pan with aluminum 
                foil. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large saucepan over medium heat, 
                combine marshmallow cream, sugar, 
                evaporated milk, butter and salt. 
                Bring to a full boil, and cook for 5 
                minutes, stirring constantly.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and pour in semisweet 
                chocolate chips and milk chocolate 
                chips. Stir until chocolate is melted 
                and mixture is smooth. Stir in nuts and 
                vanilla. Pour into prepared pan. Chill 
                in refrigerator for 2 hours, or until 
                firm.</li>
        </ol>
